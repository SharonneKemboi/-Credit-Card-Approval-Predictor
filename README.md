# **Credit Card Approval Predictor**  
*Automating credit card approval using Machine Learning for improved efficiency and accuracy.*



---

## ** Overview**
This project demonstrates how **Machine Learning (ML)** can be used to predict whether a credit card application should be **approved** or **rejected** based on historical applicant data.  
By automating the decision-making process, financial institutions can **save time**, **reduce human bias**, and **improve accuracy** in evaluating applicants.

---

## ** Features**
- Predict credit card approval based on applicant details  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Model training and evaluation (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
- Easy-to-use script for predictions  

---

## ** Dataset**
The dataset contains information such as:  
- **Personal details** (Age, Gender, Income, etc.)  
- **Employment & Financial history**  
- **Credit score & previous loan details**  

*(Dataset source: [UCI Credit Approval Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval))*

## ** Tech Stack**
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Modeling:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

## ** Model Performance**
| Model                | Accuracy | F1-Score |
|----------------------|----------|----------|
| Logistic Regression  | 85%      | 0.83     |
| Random Forest        | 89%      | 0.86     |
| Gradient Boosting    | 91%      | 0.88     |
