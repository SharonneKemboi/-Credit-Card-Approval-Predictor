## ** Overview**
Commercial banks receive a large number of credit card applications daily. Many of these applications are rejected for reasons such as:  
- High loan balances  
- Low income levels  
- Too many credit inquiries  

Manually analyzing these applications is **time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient**. Fortunately, this process can be **automated using Machine Learning**, and in fact, most banks already do so.

In this project, we build an **automatic credit card approval predictor** using machine learning techniques, just like real banks.

## ** Dataset**
We will use the **Credit Card Approval dataset** from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.  

The structure of the project is as follows:  
1. Load and view the dataset.  
2. Handle mixed data types, different ranges, and missing values.  
3. Preprocess the dataset for model training.  
4. Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to gain insights.  
5. Build a **Machine Learning model** to predict whether a credit card application will be **approved** or **rejected**.

## **Goal**
To automate the credit card approval process using **predictive analytics**, improving efficiency and accuracy for **commercial banks and financial institutions**.
